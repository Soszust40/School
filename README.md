## Project List

### Spartanmind (C++)

**Release Date:** March 23, 2025 |
**Last Updated:** March 23, 2025 |
**Developer:** [Simon Oszust](https://github.com/Soszust40)

Spartanmind is a C++ group project developed in my Object-Oriented Software Design course. It's a game inspired by Mastermind, where players control a character (like a treasure chest or Sparty the mascot) to grab and place letter tiles in a grid to guess a hidden word. The game includes unique mechanics like grabbing and releasing letters, container puzzles, and feedback for correct/incorrect letter placement. Our custom Level 3 introduced a car-themed level where letter tiles are shopping bags in a moving vehicle, and players must avoid road barriers on their way to place letters.
