## My Phone

![Phone](/images/phone.JPG)


##### My iPhone 14 Pro

Why I can't leave home without it:

- It's my main way to communicate with others.
- It has my maps to get around.
- It a camera to quickly take pictures of my surroundings.
- It has games to keep me occupied between classes.
- It also holds cards that I use for contactless payments.
